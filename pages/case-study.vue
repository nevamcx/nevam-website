                    <div class="section-content">
                        <p>Over the years, Cashflow Co. had setup multiple media channels: 2 personal LinkedIn accounts (Terry & Ryan), 1 LinkedIn business page, Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, and 2 Podcast channels (Spotify + Apple). Now that's a lot of channels to manage! Their conversion ratio's were ok, nothing incredible, but they didn't even know where to start. They needed clarity & direction in this minefield of channels & endless possible customer journeys.</p>

                        <p>Luckily, our founder Brittany was actually a client of Cashflow Co. and so we already know them. But after a while Cashflow Co. reached out to learn more about what we do. The turning point for them was really all these digital media channels that they run for marketing & course sales. It got to the point where it was becoming rather messy & they needed some clarity on how to manage this mighty marketing experience they had created.</p>

                        <p>Terry and Ryan were wearing multiple hats in their business, they are busy people! And so naturally they had some reservations about the time and effort required for our process. They were also skeptical about the value NEVAM CX could provide and whether it would truly address their needs. They needed reassurance that the solution would deliver tangible results and justify the investment cost of our services. And so we had our work cut out for us!</p>

                        <p>We analysed all Cashflow Co's media channels, including email campaigns & their social media accounts. We even reviewed their Podcast channels on Spotify & Apple podcasts! We found a many issues, including a lot of gaps where the customers drop off out of their funnel It's these "leaks" that really add up, especially with so many marketing channels involved here. We also did some performance testing of their website, and made some recommendations to speed up things for the potential customers. Finally, we documented all of our findings for them in Miro, so they can visually see how all the marketing connects to eachother. Seeing things visually is really what is missing is most marketing planning! That way it makes your planning easier.</p>

Well, because we made many recommendations, it affected a lot of their channels! Here's you can see what changed for them:</p>
