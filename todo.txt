[HOOK]
> do you know what's really interesting? your coding skills won't actually help you get a better job
> I'll repeat: your coding skills won't get you the job you want!
> and that's because, once you know some basic coding skills, only networking skills will help you get the job you want


[TRANSITION]
> before I got my first job in software, I was coding in my spare time & even worked on some side projects
> I wasn't doing anything advanced, just the basics (HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript)
> I applied for hundreds of jobs, but I hardly got any job interviews, because I didn't have any previous job experience
> and I couldn't understand why, I mean, I could do basic coding, but STILL no one wanted to give me the opportunity to work for them formally
> So I thought to myself, there must be a better way!
